# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

Currently, this is just the Back End for the WTWR app. The Front End is in another Repo. However, in this Repo, we store the users and the Clothing Items for each User using Schemas. The goal of this back end is to add User Authentication and Authorization.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

## Technology

WTWR : Back End utilizes:

    - JavaScript
    - MongoDB
    - Mongoose
    - PostMan

## Current Features

### 1. Weather Info

WTWR is connected to a Weather API that updates in real time to display the temperature and also the weather condition. This connects to the User's personal item list and displays the suggested garments of clothing for the current weather conditions.

### 2. Create New Cards

Users can add as many of their own custom cards to their profile as they would like, just add a name, a link to the photo, and choose which temperature category it belongs in!

## Future Goals

Below is a list of WTWR `FUTURE` implementations.

### 1. Custom Classes

Currently, Users are able to add clothing items and give them a value of "warm, cold, or hot" at preset temperature ranges. In future launches we would like to add the ability to add more customizable queries to personalize the experience to any user.

### 2. Friendly Fashion

Currently, you can only view your own profile and content, but in future iterations, we will add a feature to search and favorite your friend's wardrobe options! That way you can get inspiration to expand your wardrobe!
